 <h2>Downloading Nessus</h2>
 <br />

 So first you are going to want to download Nessus. Go to [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true) and download Nessus. Once you open up the download file, it is going to prompt you with some options. Go ahead and select all of the default settings until you get to the point where it opens up a new tab within your browser. Select Nessus Essentials, as it is the only free option you will have available.
