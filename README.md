 <h2>Downloading Nessus</h2>
 <br />

 So first you are going to want to download Nessus. Go to [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true) and download Nessus. Once you open up the download file, it is going to prompt you with some options. Go ahead and select all of the default settings until you get to the point where it opens up a new tab within your browser. Select Nessus Essentials, as it is the only free option you will have available. You will be prompted to enter an email, once you have selected next after entering some information, you will be sent an activation code, which you will need to enter to begin the download. Go ahead and enter that activation code and the download process will begin.

 <h2>Downloading a Windows 10 ISO File</h2>
 <br />

 Next you will need to download a Windows 10 ISO file to run as a virtual machine so that Nessus has something to scan. Go to the [Windows Download Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and click "Download Now".
