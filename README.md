# Vulnerability-Management-with-Nessus
How to use Nessus to discover vulnerabilities and using those discoveries to remediate the issues, hardening the system.

 <br />

 <H1>Setup</H1>

 <h2>Downloading Nessus</h2>
 <br />

 So first you are going to want to download Nessus. Go to [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true) and download Nessus. Once you open up the download file, it is going to prompt you with some options. Go ahead and select all of the default settings until you get to the point where it opens up a new tab within your browser. Select Nessus Essentials, as it is the only free option you will have available. You will be prompted to enter an email, once you have selected next after entering some information, you will be sent an activation code, which you will need to enter to begin the download. Go ahead and enter that activation code and the download process will begin.
 <br />
 <br />

 <h2>Downloading a Windows 10 ISO File</h2>
 <br />

 Next you will need to download a Windows 10 ISO file to run as a virtual machine so that Nessus has something to scan. Go to the [Windows Download Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and click "Download Now".

</p>

 <br />
 <br />

 Click on the "MediaCreationTool" file which will ask you to accept terms and conditions then it will have you make a few selections. Follow the below screenshots to select the right options.
 
<br />

</p>

<br />
<br />

Once you make those selections it will ask you save it to a folder where you can find it later.

<br />
<br />

<h2>Download VMware Workstation Player</h2>

<br />
<br />

Next go to this [website](https://www.vmware.com/content/vmware/vmware-published-sites/us/products/workstation-player.html.html). Click on the download for free option and click on the download to start the process. It's going to ask you to download some additional option which you have to pay for. You can if you want, but I didn't. You just need it to run a Windows 10 VM.

<br />
<br />

<h2>Opening up the Windows 10 VM</h2>

<br />
<br />

Once the download is complete, open up the VMware Workstation Player on your computer. Next, we are going to open up the VM using the download we did earlier. This is what it will look like when you open up the player:

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

<br />
<br />

Once you click on the "Create a New Virtual Machine" you will be prompted to select the file you want. Navigate to the file location and select next:

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

<br />
<br />

Click next until you get to finish then the VM Player will begin to open it. As it is booting up it will ask you to press any key to boot from disc, so go ahead and do that. It will ask you to log in, at this point you can either make a bogus account or you can use your personal account, either way is fine. It will ask you to make some customization selections, but turn everything off as you will not need any additional services other than being able to log in. This part may take awhile depending on the hardware of your computer as well as your network connection.

<br />
<br />

Once you are logged into the VM, open up Command Prompt and Run the "ipconfig" command. This will allow you to get your IP address to run the scan on Nessus.

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

<br />
<br />

<b> Note that you will not be able to ping your VM until you disable the firewall on it. You can also allow ICMP on the firewall, but we're going to keep it simple and just turn it off. Make sure to do it on all three profiles as shown below:

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

<br />
<br />

Now you should be able to ping the VM from your computer.

<br />
<br />

<h2>Scanning with Nessus</h2>

<br />
<br />

If you still have it open, go back to nessus and start a new scan using the IP from the VM:

<br />
<br />

</p>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

<br />
<br />

Now that you have started the scan, we can customize a couple options:

<br />
<br />

<b>Under the basic drop-down, you can go to schedule and this will let you customize how often you want to run this scan:

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

<br />
<br />

<b>Under the notifications tab, you can enter an email to send you a report of your scheduled scans:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/5UbAZfe.png" height="85%" width="85%" alt="Notifications"/>
</p>

<br />
<br />

<b>You can also customize the types of port scans you want to run. Basic scans will be quick and dirty; all ports will take longer, but give you a better picture; custom scans will let you decide which ports you would like to scan.

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>

<br />
<br />

<b>The credentials tab at the top will allow you to run what is called a "Credentialed Scan" which is a more in-depth scan that will go deeper into the VM and go through things like the registry that wouldn't usually be accessible on an "Uncredentialed Scan"

<br />
<br />

We can customize this even more, but we are just brushing over the basics.

<H2>Introducing some vulnerabilities</H2>

<br />
<br />

This part doesn't need to be complicated at all. I just downloaded an old version of Mozilla Firefox to get the point across. This is just to help get the point across, but the real point of this tutorial is to show what Nessus is doing for us and how it can help identify vulnerabilities on machines or in networks and from there, we can implement a SOAR to help automate some things or go in and manually eliminate the vulnerability. You can install any old version of software and it should be identified. If you click on a vulnerability, Nessus will show you how to remediate it and give you references to educate the user on the vulnerability.

Thank you guys for following along, and hopefully you were able to learn something from this.
